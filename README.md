# My-Guided-Projects-- Python
These guided projects helped me to gain hands-on programming experience and to apply the new skills I learned in Python.

## 1. Attracting More Users 
The goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store.
<br />
## 2. Investigating Netflix Movies
Performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, analyzed data further with statistics, created more advanced visualizations and learned more advanced ways of working with data in pandas.

## 3. Exploring Hacker News Posts
In this project, we'll work with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. We're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

## 5. Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates
The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. We show comparatively how the euro-dollar rate changed under the last three US presidents and we show how the euro-dollar rate changed during the 2007-2008's financial crisis.

## 6. The Android App Market on Google Play
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
